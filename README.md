# Simple Billing System

This project presents a simple yet effective billing system designed using Python and Tkinter. It's an ideal solution for small shops and businesses, enabling users to store data and generate bills efficiently, especially when integrated with a database.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** The core programming language used in this project.
- **Tkinter:** A standard GUI library for Python, used for creating the user interface.

## Setup Instructions

### For Windows

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Python is installed. In Windows, the default Python installation typically includes Tkinter. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### For Linux and macOS

- **Python Installation:** Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can install Python via your distribution's package manager for Linux or download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for macOS.

- **Tkinter Installation:**

  For **Linux**, use your distribution's package manager:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk   # For Debian-based distributions
  ```

  For **macOS**, Tkinter is typically included with the Python.org installer. If not, you can use Homebrew to install it:

  ```bash
  brew install python-tk   # Using Homebrew
  ```

## Running the Application

To launch the application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands based on your operating system:

- **For Windows:**

  ```cmd
  python billing_system.py
  ```

- **For Linux:**

  ```bash
  python3 billing_system.py
  ```

- **For macOS:**

  ```bash
  python3 billing_system.py   # Assumes Python 3 is installed
  ```

After running the appropriate command, the billing system GUI should appear, ready for use.
